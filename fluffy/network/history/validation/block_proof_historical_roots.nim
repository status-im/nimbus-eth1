# Implementation of post-merge block proofs by making use of the historical_roots
# accumulator.
# Types are defined here:
# https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/blob/31bc7e58e2e8acfba895d5a12a9ae3472894d398/history/history-network.md#block-header
#
# Proof system explained here:
# https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/blob/31bc7e58e2e8acfba895d5a12a9ae3472894d398/history/history-network.md#blockproofhistoricalroots
#
# The proof chain traverses from proving that the block hash is the one of the
# ExecutionPayload in the BeaconBlock to proving that this BeaconBlock is rooted
# in the historical_roots.
#
# The historical_roots accumulator is frozen at the Capella fork, this means that
# it can only be used for the blocks from TheMerge until the Capella fork (= Bellatrix).
#
# Requirements:
#
# - For building the proofs:
# Portal node/bridge that has access to all the beacon chain data (blocks +
# specific state) for that specific period. This can be provided through era files.
#
# - For verifying the proofs:
# To verify the proof the historical_roots field of the BeaconState is required.
# As this field is frozen, it can be baked into the client.
