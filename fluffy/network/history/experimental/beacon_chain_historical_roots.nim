# Example of how the beacon state historical_roots field could be provided with
# a Merkle proof that can be verified against the right beacon state root.
# These historical_roots with their proof could for example be provided over the
# network and verified on the receivers end.
#
# Note:
# Since Capella the historical_roots field is frozen. Thus providing the
# historical_roots with a Proof against the latest state seems a bit silly.
# One idea could be to embed it into the client just as is done for the
# execution header accumulator.
