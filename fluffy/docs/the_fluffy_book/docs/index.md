# The Nimbus Fluffy Guide

Fluffy is the Nimbus client implementation of the
[Portal network specifications](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs/blob/master/portal-network.md).

The Portal Network is a project still in research phase.
This client is thus still highly experimental.

Some of the sub-networks are already operational and can be tested in a local
setting or in the public testnet.

This book describes how to build, run and monitor the Fluffy client, and how to
test and use its currently implemented functionality.
