  # TODO:
  # Here we'd want to implement initially a loop that backfills the state
  # content. Secondly, a loop that follows the head and injects the latest
  # state changes too.
  #
  # The first step would probably be the easier one to start with, as one
  # can start from genesis state.
  # It could be implemented by using the `exp_getProofsByBlockNumber` JSON-RPC
  # method from nimbus-eth1.
  # It could also be implemented by having the whole state execution happening
  # inside the bridge, and getting the blocks from era1 files.
