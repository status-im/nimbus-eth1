# This version of content db is the most basic, simple solution where data is
# stored no matter what content type or content network in the same kvstore with
# the content id as key. The content id is derived from the content key, and the
# deriviation is different depending on the content type. As we use content id,
# this part is currently out of the scope / API of the ContentDB.
# In the future it is likely that that either:
# 1. More kvstores are added per network, and thus depending on the network a
# different kvstore needs to be selected.
# 2. Or more kvstores are added per network and per content type, and thus
# content key fields are required to access the data.
# 3. Or databases are created per network (and kvstores pre content type) and
# thus depending on the network the right db needs to be selected.
