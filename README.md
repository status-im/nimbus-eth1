## Rationale
[Nimbus: an Ethereum 2.0 Sharding Client](https://our.status.im/nimbus-for-newbies/). The code in this repository is currently focusing on Ethereum 1.0 feature parity, while all 2.0 research and development is happening in parallel in [nim-beacon-chain](https://github.com/status-im/nim-beacon-chain). The two repositories are expected to merge in Q1 2019.

## Development Updates

To keep up to date with changes and development progress, follow the [Nimbus blog](https://our.status.im/tag/nimbus/).

## Building & Testing

### Prerequisites

* A recent version of Nim
  * We use the version in the [Status fork](https://github.com/status-im/Nim)
  * Follow the Nim installation instructions or use [choosenim](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim) to manage your Nim versions
* A recent version of Facebook's [RocksDB](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/)
  * Compile [from source](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/INSTALL.md) or use the package manager of your OS; for example, [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=librocksdb-dev&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all), [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=librocksdb-dev&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all), and [Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/rocksdb) have working RocksDB packages

#### Obtaining the prerequisites through the Nix package manager

Users of the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/download.html) can install all prerequisites simply by running:

``` bash
nix-shell nimbus.nix
```

### Build & Install

We use [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble) to manage dependencies and run tests.

To build and install Nimbus in your home folder, just execute:

```bash
nimble install
```

After a succesful installation, running `nimbus --help` will provide you with a list of
the available command-line options. To start syncing with mainnet, just execute `nimbus`
without any parameters.

To execute all tests:
```bash
nimble test
```

Our Wiki provides additional helpful information for [debugging individual test cases][1]
and for [pairing Nimbus with a locally running copy of Geth][2].

### Build and Run Nimbus

```bash
nimble nimbus
./build/nimbus
```

Report any errors you encounter, please, if not [already documented](https://github.com/status-im/nimbus)!

### Development tips

- you can switch the DB backend with a Nim compiler define:
  `-d:nimbus_db_backend=...` where the (case-insensitive) value is one of
  "rocksdb" (the default), "sqlite", "lmdb".

#### Troubleshooting

Sometimes, the build will fail even though the latest CI is green - here are a few tips to handle this:

* Wrong Nim version
  * We depend on many bleeding-edge features - Nim regressions often happen
  * Use the [Status fork](https://github.com/status-im/Nim) of Nim
* Wrong versions of dependencies
  * nimble dependency tracking often breaks due to its global registry
  * wipe the nimble folder and try again
* C compile or link fails
  * Nim compile cache is pretty buggy and sometimes will fail to recompile
  * wipe your nimcache folder
