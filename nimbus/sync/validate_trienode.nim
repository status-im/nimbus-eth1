## This module parses Ethereum hexary trie nodes from bytes received over the
## network.  The data is untrusted, and a non-canonical RLP encoding of the
## node must be rejected, so this code parses carefully.
##
## The caller provides bytes and context.  Context includes node hash, trie
## path, and a boolean saying if this trie node is child of an extension node.
##
## The result of parsing is up to 16 child nodes to visit (paths with hashes),
## or up to 7 leaf nodes to decode.
##
## This doesn't verify the node hash.  The caller should ensure the bytes are
## verified against the hash separately from calling this parser.  Even
## with the hash verified, the bytes are still untrusted and must be parsed
## carefully, because the hash itself is from an untrusted source.
##
## `RlpError` exceptions may occur on some well-crafted adversarial input due
## to the RLP reader implementation.  They could be trapped and treated like
## other parse errors, but that's not done.  Instead, the caller should put
## `try..except RlpError as e` outside its trie node parsing loop, and pass the
## exception to `parseTrieNodeError` if it occurs.

  ##
  ## - Any child nodes to visit are added to `context.childQueue`, up to 16.
  ##
  ## - Any leaf nodes to decode are added to `context.leafQueue`, up to 7.
  ##
  ## - When multiple children or leaves are returned, they are guaranteed to
  ##   be in increasing path order.
  ##
  ## - If there are any errors parsing or with basic trie structure, debug
  ##   messages are logged and `context.errors` is incremented.
  ##
  ## - `nodePath` is used.  Using the path, the correct depth of branch,
  ##   extension and leaf nodes are checked by this parser.  Child and leaf
  ##   paths are calculated and stored in `childQueue` and `leafQueue`.
  ##
  ## - `nodeHash` is _not_ used to verify the bytes.
  ##
  ##   The hash is only used for diagnostics.  The caller should ensure the
  ##   bytes are verified against the hash separately from calling this
  ##   function, so there's no need to calculate the hash again here.  Even
  ##   with the hash verified, the bytes are still untrusted and must be parsed
  ##   carefully, because the hash itself is from an untrusted source.
  ##
  ## - `fromExtension` is used.  It is used to check that an extension node is
  ##   not the parent of another extension node or a leaf, as this is not
  ##   allowed in the canonical trie encoding.  This value is `false` for the
  ##   root node of a trie, otherwise it is the value stored in `childQueue`
  ##   from parsing the parent node.
  ##
  ## - The `sp: SyncPeer` is like the hash, only used for diagnostics.  When
  ##   there is invalid data, it's useful to show where we got it from.
  ##
  ## - Some limited recursion is possible while parsing, because of how < 32
  ##   byte nodes are encoded inside others.  When recursion occurs, the number
  ##   of child nodes will be 0, and the theoretical maximum number of leaf
  ##   nodes is 7, although this is only possible in contrived test cases that
  ##   disable path hashing.  This is why `leafQueue` is a list.
  ##
  ##   Recursion like this cannot occur with account nodes, because account
  ##   leaves are too large for it in the canonical Ethereum encoding.  It can
  ##   occur with storage slots.
  ##
  ## - `RlpError` exceptions may occur on some well-crafted adversarial input
  ##   due to the RLP reader implementation.  They could be caught and treated
  ##   like other parse errors, but they are not caught here, to avoid the
  ##   overhead of `try..except` in the parser (which uses C `setjmp`).  The
  ##   caller should put `try..except RlpError` outside its trie node parsing
  ##   loop, and call `parseTrieNodeError` when `RlpError` is caught.
  ##
  ## As a special case only used internally during recursion, if `nodeBytes` is
  ## shorter than 32, `nodeHash` is ignored, even for diagnostics.  These
  ## internal nodes don't have a hash and can't be fetched over the network.
