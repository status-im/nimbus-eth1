## This module provides an async function to call `GetNodeData`, a request in
## the Ethereum DevP2P/ETH network protocol.  Parallel requests can be issued,
## maintaining a pipeline.
##
## Given a list of hashes, it returns a list of trie nodes or contract
## bytecodes matching those hashes.  The returned nodes may be any subset of
## those requested, including an empty list.  The returned nodes are not
## necessarily in the same order as the request, so a mapping from request
## items to node items is included.  On timeout or error, `nil` is returned.
##
## Only data passing hash verification is returned, so hashes don't need to be
## verified again.  No exceptions are raised, and no detail is returned about
## timeouts or errors, but systematically formatted trace messages are output
## if enabled, and show in detail if various events occur such as timeouts,
## bad hashes, mixed replies, network errors, etc.
##
## This tracks queued requests and individual request hashes, verifies received
## node data hashes, and matches them against requests.  When a peer replies in
## same order as requests are sent, and each reply contains nodes in the same
## order as requested, the matching process is efficient.  It avoids storing
## request details in a hash table when possible.  If replies or nodes are out
## of order, the process is still efficient but has to do a little more work.
##
## Empty replies:
##
## Empty replies are matched with requests using a queue draining technique.
## After an empty reply is received, we temporarily pause further requests and
## wait for more replies.  After we receive all outstanding replies, we know
## which requests the empty replies were for, and can complete those requests.
##
## Eth/66 protocol:
##
## Although Eth/66 simplifies by matching replies to requests, replies can still
## have data out of order or missing, so hashes still need to be verified and
## looked up.  Much of the code here is still required for Eth/66.

## Note:

## This should be made generic for other request types which need similar hash
## matching.  Before this module was written, we tended to accept whatever came
## and assume a lot about replies.  It often worked but wasn't robust enough.
