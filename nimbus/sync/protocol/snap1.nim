## This module implements `snap/1`, the `Ethereum Snapshot Protocol (SNAP)
## <https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/snap.md>`_.
##
## Modifications for *Geth* compatibility
## --------------------------------------
##
## `GetAccountRange` and `GetStorageRanges` take parameters `origin` and
## `limit`, instead of a single `startingHash` parameter in the
## specification. The parameters `origin` and `limit` are 256-bit paths
## representing the starting hash and ending trie path, both inclusive.
##
## The `snap/1` specification doesn't match reality. If the specification is
## strictly followed omitting `limit`, *Geth 1.10* disconnects immediately so
## this implementation strives to meet the *Geth* behaviour.
##
## Results from either call may include one item with path `>= limit`. *Geth*
## fetches data from its internal database until it reaches this condition or
## the bytes threshold, then replies with what it fetched.  Usually there is
## no item at the exact path `limit`, so there is one after.
##
##
## Modified `GetStorageRanges` (0x02) message syntax
## ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
##
## As implementes here, the request message is encoded as
##
## `[reqID, rootHash, accountHashes, origin, limit, responseBytes]`
##
## It requests the storage slots of multiple accounts' storage tries. Since
## certain contracts have huge state, the method can also request storage
## slots from a single account, starting at a specific storage key hash.
## The intended purpose of this message is to fetch a large number of
## subsequent storage slots from a remote node and reconstruct a state
## subtrie locally.
##
## * `reqID`: Request ID to match up responses with
## * `rootHash`: 32 byte root hash of the account trie to serve
## * `accountHashes`: Array of 32 byte account hashes of the storage tries to serve
## * `origin`: Storage slot hash fragment of the first to retrieve (see below)
## * `limit`: Storage slot hash fragment after which to stop serving (see below)
## * `responseBytes`: 64 bit number soft limit at which to stop returning data
##
## Discussion of *Geth* `GetStorageRanges` behaviour
## ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
##
## - Parameters `origin` and `limit` may each be empty blobs, which mean "all
##   zeros" (0x00000...) or "no limit" (0xfffff...)  respectively.
##
##   (Blobs shorter than 32 bytes can also be given, and they are extended with
##   zero bytes; longer than 32 bytes can be given and are truncated, but this
##   is *Geth* being too accepting, and shouldn't be used.)
##
## - In the `slots` reply, the last account's storage list may be empty even if
##   that account has non-empty storage.
##
##   This happens when the bytes threshold is reached just after finishing
##   storage for the previous account, or when `origin` is greater than the
##   first account's last storage slot.  When either of these happens, `proof`
##   is non-empty.  In the case of `origin` zero or empty, the non-empty proof
##   only contains the left-side boundary proof, because it meets the condition
##   for omitting the right-side proof described in the next point.
##
## - In the `proof` reply, the right-side boundary proof is only included if
##   the last returned storage slot has non-zero path and `origin != 0`, or if
##   the result stops due to reaching the bytes threshold.
##
##   Because there's only one proof anyway if left-side and right-side are the
##   same path, this works out to mean the right-side proof is omitted in cases
##   where `origin == 0` and the result stops at a slot `>= limit` before
##   reaching the bytes threshold.
##
##   Although the specification doesn't say anything about `limit`, this is
##   against the spirit of the specification rule, which says the right-side
##   proof is always included if the last returned path differs from the
##   starting hash.
##
##   The omitted right-side proof can cause problems when using `limit`.
##   In other words, when doing range queries, or merging results from
##   pipelining where different `stateRoot` hashes are used as time progresses.
##   Workarounds:
##
##   * Fetch the proof using a second `GetStorageRanges` query with non-zero
##     `origin` (perhaps equal to `limit`; use `origin = 1` if `limit == 0`).
##
##   * Avoid the condition by using `origin >= 1` when using `limit`.
##
##   * Use trie node traversal (`snap` `GetTrieNodes` or `eth` `GetNodeData`)
##     to obtain the omitted proof.
##
## - When multiple accounts are requested with `origin > 0`, only one account's
##   storage is returned.  There is no point requesting multiple accounts with
##   `origin > 0`.  (It might be useful if it treated `origin` as applying to
##   only the first account, but it doesn't.)
##
## - When multiple accounts are requested with non-default `limit` and
##   `origin == 0`, and the first account result stops at a slot `>= limit`
##   before reaching the bytes threshold, storage for the other accounts in the
##   request are returned as well.  The other accounts are not limited by
##   `limit`, only the bytes threshold.  The right-side proof is omitted from
##   `proof` when this happens, because this is the same condition as described
##   earlier for omitting the right-side proof.  (It might be useful if it
##   treated `origin` as applying to only the first account and `limit` to only
##   the last account, but it doesn't.)
##
## Modified `GetAccountRange` (0x00) packet syntax
## ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
##
## As implementes here, the request message is encoded as
##
## `[reqID, rootHash, origin, limit, responseBytes]`
##
## It requests an unknown number of accounts from a given account trie, starting
## at the specified account hash and capped by the maximum allowed response
## size in bytes. The intended purpose of this message is to fetch a large
## number of subsequent accounts from a remote node and reconstruct a state
## subtrie locally.
##
## The `GetAccountRange` parameters `origin` and `limit` must be 32 byte
## blobs. There is no reason why empty limit is not allowed here when it is
## allowed for `GetStorageRanges`, it just isn't.
##
## * `reqID`: Request ID to match up responses with
## * `rootHash`: Root hash of the account trie to serve
## * `origin`: 32 byte storage slot hash of the first to retrieve
## * `limit`: 32 byte storage slot hash fragment after which to stop serving
## * `responseBytes`: 64 bit number soft limit at which to stop returning data
##
##
## Performance benefits
## --------------------
##
## `snap` is used for much higher performance transfer of the entire Ethereum
## execution state (accounts, storage, bytecode) compared with hexary trie
## traversal using `eth` `GetNodeData`.
##
## It improves both network and local storage performance.  The benefits are
## substantial, and summarised here:
##
## - `Ethereum Snapshot Protocol (SNAP) - Expected results
##    <https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/snap.md>`_
## - `Geth v1.10.0 - Snap sync
##    <https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/#snap-sync>`_
##
## In the Snap sync model, local storage benefits require clients to adopt a
## different representation of Ethereum state than the trie storage that *Geth*
## (and most clients) traditionally used, and still do in archive mode,
##
## However, Nimbus's sync method obtains similar local storage benefits
## whichever network protocol is used.  Nimbus uses `snap` protocol because it
## is a more efficient network protocol.
##
## Remote state and Beam sync benefits
## -----------------------------------
##
## `snap` was not intended for Beam sync, or "remote state on demand", used by
## transactions executing locally that fetch state from the network instead of
## local storage.
##
## Even so, as a lucky accident `snap` allows individual states to be fetched
## in fewer network round trips than `eth`.  Often a single round trip,
## compared with about 10 round trips per account query over `eth`.  This is
## because `eth` `GetNodeData` requires a trie traversal chasing hashes
## sequentially, while `snap` `GetTrieNode` trie traversal can be done with
## predictable paths.
##
## Therefore `snap` can be used to accelerate remote states and Beam sync.
##
## Distributed hash table (DHT) building block
## -------------------------------------------
##
## Although `snap` was designed for bootstrapping clients with the entire
## Ethereum state, it is well suited to fetching only a subset of path ranges.
## This may be useful for bootstrapping distributed hash tables (DHTs).
##
## Path range metadata benefits
## ----------------------------
##
## Because data is handled in path ranges, this allows a compact metadata
## representation of what data is stored locally and what isn't, compared with
## the size of a representation of partially completed trie traversal with
## `eth` `GetNodeData`.  Due to the smaller metadata, after aborting a partial
## sync and restarting, it is possible to resume quickly, without waiting for
## the very slow local database scan associated with older versions of *Geth*.
##
## However, Nimbus's sync method uses this principle as inspiration to
## obtain similar metadata benefits whichever network protocol is used.
