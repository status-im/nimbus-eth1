## This module fetches the Ethereum account state trie from network peers by
## traversing the trie from the root, making network requests.
##
## Requests are batched, pipelined, sorted, sliced and load-balanced.
##
## - Batching and pipelining improve network performance to each peer.
##
## - Load-balancing allows the available of multiple peers to be used.
##
## - Sorting and slicing is a key part of the pie sync algorithm, which allows
##   the entire Ethereum state to be fetched, even following hash trie
##   pointers, without significant random access database I/O.

  # WIP NOTE: The algorithm below is out of date and is not the final algorithm
  # (which doesn't need to sort).  Below gets some of the job done, but it can
  # exhaust memory in pathological cases depending how the peers respond, and
  # it cannot track prograss or batch the leaves for storage.  Its replacement
  # is actually simpler but depends on a data structure which has yet to be
  # merged.  Also, it doesn't use `Future` so much.
  #
  # OLD NOTE: Sort individual requests in order of path.  The sort is
  # descending order but they are popped off the end of the sequence (for O(1)
  # removal) so are processed in ascending order of path.
  #
  # For large state tries, this is important magic:
  #
  # - This sort and the bounded max nodes/requests limits together cause
  #   trie traversal to use depth-first order instead of breadth-first.
  # - More precisely, it uses approximate depth-first order, but if that
  #   would result in any unused capacity in the network request pipelining,
  #   that capacity is used to fetch additional nodes instead of wasted.
  # - Depth-first (approximate) has an important effect of limiting memory used.
  #   With breadth-first it would use a vast amount of memory on large tries.
  #
  # - The pipelining modification to depth-first completely changes network
  #   behaviour.  It allows a pipeline to bootstrap until it's properly full.
  # - Without the modification, strict depth-first would be much slower as
  #   every request would wait for a round-trip before starting the next.
  #
  # - The trie traversal is also in left-to-right path order (also approximate).
  # - The leaves are fetched in left-to-right path order (also approximate).
  #
  # - The left-to-right order is very beneficial to the remote database reads.
  # - Even though hashes for lookup are randomly ordered, and the remote must
  #   use them in lookups, many remote databases store the leaves in some way
  #   indexed by path.  If so, this order will greatly improve lookup locality,
  #   which directly reduces the amount of storage I/O time and latency.
  # - The left-to-right order is beneficial to the local database writes as well.
  # - If the local database indexes by path, the left-to-right write order will
  #   increase storage density by a lot in a B-tree compared with random order.
  # - If the local database doesn't index by path at all, but does use "rowid"
  #   internally (like SQLite by default), the left-to-right write order will
  #   improve read performance when other peers sync reading this local node.
