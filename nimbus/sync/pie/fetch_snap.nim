## This module fetches the Ethereum account state trie from network peers by
## traversing leaves of the trie in leaf path order, making network requests
## using the `snap` protocol.
##
## From the leaves it is possible to reconstruct parts of a full trie.  With a
## separate trie traversal process it is possible to efficiently update the
## leaf states for related tries (new blocks), and merge partial data from
## different related tries (blocks at different times) together in a way that
## eventually becomes a full trie for a single block.
