This folder contains an experimental C API for using parts of the nimbus
code from C/go in the status console client:

https://github.com/status-im/status-console-client/

It serves mainly as a proof-of-concept for now - there are several unresolved
issues surrounding threading, inter-language communication, callbacks etc.
