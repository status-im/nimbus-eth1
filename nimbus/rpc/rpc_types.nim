  Notes:
    * Some of the types suppose 'null' when there is no appropriate value.
      To allow for this, you can use Option[T] or use refs so the JSON transform can convert to `JNull`.
    * Parameter objects from users must have their data verified so will use EthAddressStr instead of EthAddres, for example
    * Objects returned to the user can use native Nimbus types, where hexstrings provides converters to hex strings.
      This is because returned arrays in JSON is
      a) not an efficient use of space
      b) not the format the user expects (for example addresses are expected to be hex strings prefixed by "0x")
