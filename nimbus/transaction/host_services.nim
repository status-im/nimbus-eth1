  # Conversion issues:
  #
  # `txContext.tx_gas_price` is 256-bit, but `vmState.txGasPrice` is 64-bit
  # signed (`GasInt`), and in reality it tends to be a fairly small integer,
  # usually < 16 bits.  Our EVM truncates whatever it gets blindly to 64-bit
  # anyway.  Largest ever so far may be 100,000,000.
  # https://medium.com/amberdata/most-expensive-transaction-in-ethereum-blockchain-history-99d9a30d8e02
  #
  # `txContext.block_number` is 64-bit signed.  This is actually too small for
  # the Nimbus `BlockNumber` type which is 256-bit (for now), so we truncate
  # the other way.
  #
  # `txContext.chain_id` is 256-bit, but `vmState.chaindb.config.chainId` is
  # 64-bit or 32-bit depending on the target CPU architecture (Nim `uint`).
  # Our EVM truncates whatever it gets blindly to 64-bit or 32-bit.
  #
  # No conversion required with the other fields:
  #
  # `txContext.tx_origin` and `txContext.block_coinbase` are 20-byte Ethereum
  # addresses, no issues with these.
  #
  # `txContext.block_timestamp` is 64-bit signed.  `vmState.timestamp.toUnix`
  # is from Nim `std/times` and returns `int64` so this matches.  (It's
  # overkill that we store a full seconds and nanoseconds object in
  # `vmState.timestamp` though.)
  #
  # `txContext.block_gas_limit` is 64-bit signed (EVMC assumes
  # [EIP-1985](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1985) although it's not
  # officially accepted), and `vmState.gasLimit` is too (`GasInt`).
  #
  # `txContext.block_prev_randao` is 256-bit, and this one can genuinely take
  # values over much of the 256-bit range.
