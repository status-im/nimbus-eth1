    # Yellow Paper Appendix H - https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf
    # Special notes from Yellow Paper:
    #   - Signed values are treated as two’s complement signed 256-bit integers.
    #   - When −2^255 is negated, there is an overflow
    #   - For addmod and mulmod, intermediate computations are not subject to the 2^256 modulo.
    #     Nimbus authors note:
    #        - This means that we can't naively do (Uint256 + Uint256) mod uint256,
    #          because the intermediate sum (or multiplication) might roll over if
    #          intermediate result is greater or equal 2^256
