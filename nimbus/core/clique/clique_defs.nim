## and

const
  # clique/clique.go(48): const ( [..]
  CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL* = ##\
    ## Number of blocks after which to save the vote snapshot to the database
    4 * 1024

  INMEMORY_SNAPSHOTS* = ##\
    ## Number of recent vote snapshots to keep in memory.
    128

  WIGGLE_TIME* = ##\
    ## PoA mining only (currently unsupported).
    ##
    ## Random delay (per signer) to allow concurrent signers
    initDuration(seconds = 0, milliseconds = 500)

  # clique/clique.go(57): var ( [..]
  BLOCK_PERIOD* = ##\
    ## Minimum difference in seconds between two consecutive block timestamps.
    ## Suggested time is 15s for the `testnet` to remain analogous to the
    ## `mainnet` ethash target.
    initDuration(seconds = 15)

  EXTRA_VANITY* = ##\
    ## Fixed number of extra-data prefix bytes reserved for signer vanity.
    ## Suggested 32 bytes to retain the current extra-data allowance and/or use.
    32

  NONCE_AUTH* = ##\
    ## Magic nonce number 0xffffffffffffffff to vote on adding a new signer.
    0xffffffffffffffffu64.toBlockNonce

  NONCE_DROP* = ##\
    ## Magic nonce number 0x0000000000000000 to vote on removing a signer.
    0x0000000000000000u64.toBlockNonce

  DIFF_NOTURN* = ##\
    ## Block score (difficulty) for blocks containing out-of-turn signatures.
    ## Suggested 1 since it just needs to be an arbitrary baseline constant.
    1.u256

  DIFF_INTURN* = ##\
    ## Block score (difficulty) for blocks containing in-turn signatures.
    ## Suggested 2 to show a slight preference over out-of-turn signatures.
    2.u256

  # params/network_params.go(60): FullImmutabilityThreshold = 90000
  FULL_IMMUTABILITY_THRESHOLD* = ##\
    ## Number of blocks after which a chain segment is considered immutable (ie.
    ## soft finality). It is used by the downloader as a hard limit against
    ## deep ancestors, by the blockchain against deep reorgs, by the freezer as
    ## the cutoff threshold and by clique as the snapshot trust limit.
    90000

  # Other
  SNAPS_LOG_INTERVAL_MICSECS* = ##\
    ##  Time interval after which the `snapshotApply()` function main loop
    ## produces logging entries. The original value from the Go reference
    ## implementation has 8 seconds (which seems a bit long.) For the first
    ## 300k blocks in the Goerli chain, typical execution time in tests was
    ## mostly below 300 micro secs.
    initDuration(microSeconds = 200)
