    ## If there are more failing peers than this threshold right at the
    ## begining of a header chain download scrum (before any data received),

    ## session.)

  nFetchHeadersRequest* = 800
    ## Number of headers that will be requested with a single `eth/xx` message.

    ## entries (see `Geth` constant `maxHeadersServe`.)

  fetchHeadersRlpxTimeout* = chronos.seconds(50)
    ## Timeout cap for the `RLPX` handler when fetching header. This value
    ## should pretty large so that even in case that the peer is delaying
    ## (typically due to downloading from here), there will be a valid data
    ## response in many cases.
    ##
    ## The system calculates the elapsed time which covers request, response,
    ## and some kind of actions in-between including some peer download
    ## data provided by this system.
    ##
    ## The elapsed time is then used to assess a peer so that low performing
    ## peers (over the network) can be assigned `slow` (meant figuratively,
    ## not literally `slow`, but nevertheless leading to long download delays.)

  fetchHeadersErrTimeout* = chronos.seconds(25)
  nFetchHeadersErrThreshold* = 4
    ## Response time allowance (see also comment on `fetchHeadersRlpxTimeout`.)
    ## If the response time for the set of headers exceeds this threshold for
    ## more than `nFetchHeadersErrThreshold` times in a row, then this peer will
    ## be banned for a while.

  nProcHeadersErrThreshold* = 2
    ## Similar to `nFetchHeadersErrThreshold` but for the later part when
    ## errors occur while block headers are queued and further processed.

  nStashHeadersErrThreshold* = 2
    ## Abort headers download and the whole sync session with it if too many
    ## failed header chain cache storage requests occur.

  headersStagedQueueLengthMax* = 8
    ## If the staged header queue reaches this many queue objects for
    ## serialising and caching on disk, no further objects are added.

  nProcBlocksErrThreshold* = 2
