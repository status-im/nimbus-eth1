Data Dump Inspection
====================

Inspection
----------

Given a (probably gzipped) data dump file *<dump-file>* from tracing, its
content can be visualised via

	test_logger_cat < <dump-file>

where the source code *test_logger_cat.nim* for the *test_logger_cat*
command is found in the sub-folder *./test*.
