# XXX: when all but a relative few dozen, say, GeneralStateTests run, remove this,
# but for now, this enables some CI use before that to prevent regressions. In the
# separate file here because it would otherwise just distract. Could use all sorts
# of O(1) or O(log n) lookup structures, or be more careful to only initialize the
# table once, but notion's that it should shrink reasonable quickly and disappear,
# being mostly used for short-term regression prevention.
